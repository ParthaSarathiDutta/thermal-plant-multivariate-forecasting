# Thermal Power Plant Performance Modeling with Deep Learning

This project presents a comparative analysis of deep learning architecturesâ€”Deep Neural Networks (DNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM)â€”for multivariate regression modeling of key output parameters in a thermal power plant based on its operational data.

## Project Overview

Thermal power plants exhibit complex, nonlinear, and time-dependent behavior. Conventional physics-based or linear models often fail to accurately capture these dynamics. In this work, we explore deep learning techniques to model and predict:

* **Turbine power output**
* **Desuperheater feedwater flow**
* **Temperature and pressure at multiple control points**

---

## Models Evaluated

* **DNN**: Fully connected networks with up to three hidden layers.
* **CNN (ResNet-inspired)**: 1D convolutional architecture tailored for time-series data.
* **RNN (LSTM)**: Long Short-Term Memory network for modeling temporal dependencies.

## Dataset

* **Source**: [Kaggle - Power Plant Data Optimization](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deepakburi062/power-plant-data-optimization-problem)
* **Size**: 17,280 rows Ã— 116 columns
* **Preprocessing**:

  * Column renaming to match power plant terminology
  * Outlier handling
  * Feature normalization using `MinMaxScaler`
  * 70/30 train-test split

## Model Performance

| Model                 | Train RÂ²  | Test RÂ²   | Test MSE   |
| --------------------- | --------- | --------- | ---------- |
| DNN (3-layer sigmoid) | 0.89      | 0.86      | 0.1344     |
| CNN (ResNet)          | 0.985     | 0.916     | 0.0800     |
| **LSTM (RNN)**        | **0.957** | **0.941** | **0.0600** |

> The LSTM-based RNN demonstrated the best generalization performance on the test set.
